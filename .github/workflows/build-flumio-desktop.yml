# Grammar fixes:
# - "so now make github action that will triggered in release branch
#    and will run mac arm64 and win x 64 and linux x64
#    and publish it as github 'artifacts' or something so users can donwload it"
#   ->
#   "So now make a GitHub Action that will be triggered on the release branch,
#    run mac arm64, Windows x64 and Linux x64 builds,
#    and publish them as GitHub artifacts so users can download them."

# File: .github/workflows/build-flumio-desktop.yml
#
# What this does:
# - Trigger on push to branch "release"
# - Build Flumio Desktop on:
#     * macOS (arm64)
#     * Windows (x64)
#     * Linux (x64)
# - Run your existing build: tsc + electron-builder
# - Upload the generated installers in dist/ as GitHub Actions artifacts
#
# NOTE:
# - Users can download artifacts from the Actions page.
#   If you want nice public download links, you can later add a "upload to GitHub Releases" step.
